Yet because Fischer’s account of the Fortspinnungstypus theme type is more suggestive than definitive, a lack of consensus concerning its analytical application has resulted, hindering its broader adoption. This essay addresses the shortcomings of Fortspinnung theorizing by setting it on a firmer foundation. To do so, the article first recounts the history of the concept from its origins in Fischer’s writing through its alterations by later German theorists and its adoption in the English-language literature. It then proposes a new definition for Fortspinnung that reconceptualizes it in accordance with form-functional theory. To conclude it contextualizes the formal function of Fortspinnung by examining how the function’s expression varies in different genres.},author={CALEB MUTCH},journal={Theory and Practice},number={},pages={1--32},publisher={Music Theory Society of New York State},title={The Formal Function of Fortspinnung},urldate={2024-06-15},volume={43},year={2018}}
