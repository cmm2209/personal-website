summary: An uncovering of the parallels between Romantic-era biological science and musical form.
abstract: 'The rise of organicist metaphors and the development of formal theories are two striking early-nineteenth century developments, and although they have received scholarly attention, the significance of their intermingling has been overlooked. By examining the writings of A.B. Marx and his predecessors, I find that methods of considering musical form have important parallels with developments in biology, parallels which newly illuminate how Romantic _Formenlehre_ arose from a reconceptualization of animal and musical bodies.'
