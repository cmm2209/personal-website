summary: A new reading of the role of speculative mathematics in the origins of the theory of the triad.
abstract: 'Johannes Lippius is widely acclaimed as the first author to articulate fully the modern concept of the musical triad.  Lippius speaks of the triad’s fundamental pitch, which maintains its status even when not present in the lowest voice.  He also he uses the term “root” (radix), but not for that fundamental pitch: curiously, Lippius’s notion of the triadic root scarcely overlaps at all with our modern idea.  Attending to the complexities of Lippius’s conception of the root, I demonstrate its hitherto overlooked relationship to Nicholas of Cusa’s notion of the “unitary root” in his idiosyncratic and influential fusion of Trinitarian doctrine and Neopythagorean numerology.  I reveal that for Lippius the root is the first unfolding of the principle of number itself and thus is a powerful expression of music’s relationship to the divine.'
