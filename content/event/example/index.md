summary: An analysis of the interaction of production and formal structure in two songs by Taylor Swift.
abstract: 'Rarely do pop stars call explicit attention to their songs’ formal design. Taylor Swift, though, often announces which song in a concert is the first with a bridge, and critics and her fans have responded to this emphasis by creating numerous websites evaluating and ranking her songs’ bridges. The choruses, too, of her songs merit analytical attention. This paper examines two recent Swift songs, “the lakes” (2020) and “You’re on your Own, Kid” (2022), each of which has been released in two versions that differ in their approaches to the chorus section. I illustrate how the alternate versions of the two songs follow the conventions of verse, prechorus, and chorus sections. I then turn to the album version of each song to demonstrate how changes in production have altered its formal implications by adding to the chorus a prechorus-like sense of intensification and drive towards a climax. Attending to how Swift signals and subverts formal organization in her choruses also offers new insight into how the songs’ formal design adds depth to the meaning of their lyrics.

With respect to its lyrics, “the lakes” is formally conventional. The so-called “original version” of the song strongly projects its verse-chorus structure by thunderously emphasizing the chorus. By contrast, in the album version the chorus maintains a texture similar to that of the verse but gradually intensifies, recasting the entire section as a prechorus. Instead, the music deflates, returning to the verse and leaving listeners with a sense of denied potential that reinforces the lyrics’ elegiac tone. The lyrics of “You’re on your Own, Kid” suggest two verse-chorus units and an extended chorus. That concluding chorus, though, is greatly extended: as it loops, it intensifying character gradually overwrites its sense of being a chorus with that of being a prechorus, before finally syncing up with the ending of the previous choruses. The formal outlines of the chorus section have been preserved, but a new mid-chorus “prechorus” has been inserted within. Swift’s solo performance of the song, by contrast, attenuates the sense of prechorus intensification, and the audience’s singing subverts the song’s message.'
