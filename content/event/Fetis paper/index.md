summary: An analysis of Fétis’s concept of tonalité and its relation to cultural relativism.
abstract: 'Scholars who research F.J. Fétis and his concept of <i>tonalité</i> have made a strong case for his dependence on the ideas of Kant, the early German Idealists, and Hegel. In doing so they emphasize the progress-oriented aspects of Fétis’s narrative, but consequently struggle to account for his tenet that “art does not progress, but transforms itself.” This paper explains these non-teleological aspects of Fétis’s perspective by turning to J. G. von Herder, an important forefather of anthropology. I demonstrate that Herder’s views on human history and progress foreshadow, and almost certainly influenced, those of Fétis, and I conclude by drawing upon one of Fétis’s late works to suggest that he may have attempted to reconcile these two threads of his narrative.'
