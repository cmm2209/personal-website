summary: Implementing the integration of the Thinking Music project with the OCHRE database
---
The [Thinking Music: Global Sources for the History of Music Theory](https://neubauercollegium.uchicago.edu/research/thinking-music) project is producing an anthology of history music theories from around the world. Publishing the resulting project in an open-access format is an ethical imperative for a project of this kind, and we are pleased to be pairing with the University of Chicago's [Online Publication Service](https://onlinepublications.uchicago.edu/).

As the Digital Director of the project, I am responsible for integrating our anthology's contents into the University of Chicago's [OCHRE database](https://voices.uchicago.edu/ochre/), whence the materials will be assembled into the final online publication. This entails handling the digitization of theoretical sources in more than fifty languages, as well as a variety of multi-media formats. I am working together with the Online Publication Service staff to develop a custom taxonomy that will structure our project's data. We will take full advantage of OCHRE's semi-structured graph database to richly label all the data we input, thereby allowing the anthology's readers to access its many sources through a wide variety of browsing parameters and undertake data analysis of curated materials from around the world.
