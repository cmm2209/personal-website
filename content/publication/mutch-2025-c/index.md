abstract: 'This article proposes a new emendation to a problematic passage from the pseudo-Aristotelian _Problemata_, section XIX. It surveys prior editors’ strategies for emending the passage and explains why the new proposal is preferable. This emendation also is supported by the Latin manuscript tradition, as a concluding discussion of Bartholomew of Messina’s Latin translation reveals.'
