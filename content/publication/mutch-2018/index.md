abstract: The concept of Fortspinnung was first proposed a century ago by Wilhelm
  Fischer to aid his project of describing how the high classical style developed
  from its baroque forebear, and scholars have applied it to serve a variety of ends
  in the intervening years. Yet because Fischer’s account of the Fortspinnungstypus
  theme type is more suggestive than definitive, a lack of consensus concerning its
  analytical application has resulted, hindering its broader adoption. This essay
  addresses the shortcomings of Fortspinnung theorizing by setting it on a firmer
  foundation. To do so, the article first recounts the history of the concept from
  its origins in Fischer’s writing through its alterations by later German theorists
  and its adoption in the English-language literature. It then proposes a new definition
  for Fortspinnung that reconceptualizes it in accordance with form-functional theory.
  To conclude it contextualizes the formal function of Fortspinnung by examining how
  the function’s expression varies in different genres.
